# Frontend Master Bootcamp: Swiper Gallery Project

## Introduction

This project is part 2 of the "Using JavaScript in Websites" course from the Frontend Masters Bootcamp. Part 1, which can be found [here](https://github.com/tak40/fm-bootcamp-interactive), involved creating a basic image gallery. This part focuses on an advanced version using libraries. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Swiper library for a smooth scrolling gallery and GSAP for animations. This project was a great way to revisit the basics of JavaScript while also learning how to integrate and use libraries.

## Features

- **HTML and CSS**: Utilizes HTML for structure and CSS for styling the image gallery.
- **JavaScript**: Implements functionality to navigate through the gallery images using Swiper and GSAP libraries.
- **Swiper Library**: Provides a smooth scrolling gallery with pagination, navigation, and scrollbar.
- **GSAP**: Adds animation to the logo, making it draggable and interactive.

## Personal Learnings

While working on this project, I revisited and found several concepts interesting and important:

- **HTML and CSS Basics**: Reinforced the basics of structuring an HTML document and applying CSS styles.
- **Swiper Library**: Gained experience in integrating and configuring the Swiper library for a better user experience.
- **GSAP Animations**: Learned how to create interactive and draggable elements using GSAP.
